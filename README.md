# Task: Word Translator

Use jQuery and any other tool to implement a simple one-page app to translate
sentences from one language to another. All the HTML is already present in
`word_translator.html` file, just add the JS (CoffeeScript) code and occassionally, 
if you feel like it, some CSS styling. 

**Good luck!**
